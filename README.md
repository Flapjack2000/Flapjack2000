Hi, I'm Zach! I'm a computer science and mathematics student from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I have all sorts of projects on here. Here are the ones I'm most proud of:
### [Spectra](https://spectra-three-glsl.vercel.app/) - a 3D shader visualization tool that updates as you write shader code
* built with NextJS, uses React state to handle updated GLSL code
* uses ThreeJS to render scene with various 3D geometry options
* several demo shaders made by yours truly

### [Bézier Curve Creator](https://bezzy-qkxj.onrender.com/)
* Java backend with Spring Boot framwork
* uses Bernstein polynomials to calculate Bézier curve from user-defined control points
* Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, HTML canvas
